This website will be a place where I can share the steps that I took to get to where my project is now.

Pi Audioplayer:
   
   I learned alot from making this Audioplayer using python, (yes, it is simple) but this is the first actual computer engineering project that I have done ever so I feel this is a good beginning. I learned 
   python syntax and how external processes work like making python run VLC as a process, Practiced working with others(my partner) and learned alot about computer hardware and software, like when I need to
   troubleshoot and debug the code and improve on it. This is also something that applies to everythinn else I do such as never giving up and always getting better at anything I do and more practice especially when there is 
   so many different IDE's that exist that all have different syntax.
